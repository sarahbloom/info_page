									<h3>What The Workout Solo Project</h3>
									<p>During my time at Prime, I completed an individual full stack application which allows
										a user to easily login, create a profile, and create and track workouts. 
										The user can update the workout details while creating a workout and during a workout
										session. The user is able to easily see what exercises were completed in the past 
										and determine the best exercises going forward.
